## General Info
This workday calendar application was created using starter code, provided by the University of Utah Coding Bootcamp, which can be found [here](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/crispy-octo-meme).

The workday calendar allows the user to input text into the schedule and save it, to keep track of their day-to-day events for their work. There is a button to clear all listed events, and a feature to track the past, present, and future events depending on the current hour of the day.
